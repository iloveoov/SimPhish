	<h2>Detecting Phishing Emails</h2>
		<h4>Verify Identities</h4>
		<p>False identities are used to make you believe emails are from a trusted source to encourage you to divulge sensitive information. Look at the email address and ensure the sender is valid.</p>
		<h4>Beware of Urgency</h4>
		<p>Bad actors try to add a sense of urgency to the email so you don't have time to think. Always verify if it is from who you think it is.</p>
		<h4>Look but Don't Click</h4>
		<p>Hover or mouse over parts of the email without clicking. The pop-up text may look strange or not match the description of  the message.</p>
		<h4>Check for Errors</h4>
		<p>Emails may also have spelling or grammatical errors. If anything raises suspicious, report it.</p>
